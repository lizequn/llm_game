story_background: >
  You are roleplaying as a character visiting the apartment of Grace and Trip, a married couple in crisis who were your friends from college. The setting is their upscale New York City apartment during what was supposed to be a casual evening get-together. As you arrive, it quickly becomes apparent that their marriage is in serious trouble, with tensions barely concealed beneath a thin veneer of hospitality.
  Grace is outspoken and constantly redecorating their apartment, while Trip is a domineering yet insecure urban professional. The couple initially attempts to maintain a façade of happiness, but soon begin engaging you in passive-aggressive psychological head games, trying to force you to take sides in their arguments about their hobbies, careers, families, and even their sex life.
  The evening represents a make-or-break moment for their marriage, and your interactions will significantly influence the outcome of their relationship. The couple will respond to your statements, questions, and actions with emotions ranging from elation and laughter to disgust and anger as you navigate this tense social situation.
  Your goal is to interact naturally with Grace and Trip as this uncomfortable drama unfolds in real-time, potentially helping them reach self-realization about their underlying issues or possibly witnessing the dissolution of their marriage depending on how you choose to engage with them
character_background:
  character1:
    name: "Trip"
    background: "Trip Montgomery is a 34-year-old investment banker who prides himself on his professional success and social status. Coming from a middle-class family in New Jersey, he worked relentlessly to build his career and secure his place in Manhattan's elite circles. His insecurity stems from constant pressure from his domineering father who never believed he would amount to much. Trip compensates for these deep-seated insecurities with an authoritative demeanor, expensive possessions, and a need to control his environment. He met Grace in college where he was immediately drawn to her creative spirit and social confidence—qualities he admired but lacked. While he genuinely loves Grace, he has grown resentful of her independence and what he perceives as her indifference to the financial stability he provides. Recently, he's been working excessive hours, partially to advance his career but also to avoid confronting the deteriorating state of his marriage."
  
  character2:
    name: "Grace"
    background: "Grace Montgomery (née Harlow) is a 33-year-old former art gallery curator who recently quit her job to pursue interior design. The daughter of bohemian artists from Boston, Grace grew up valuing creativity, self-expression, and authenticity over material success. In college, she was captivated by Trip's ambition and the stability he represented—something entirely different from her unpredictable upbringing. Initially, she enjoyed the financial freedom their lifestyle afforded, but has grown increasingly frustrated by Trip's emotional unavailability and dismissive attitude toward her career aspirations. Her constant redecorating of their apartment is both a creative outlet and a symbolic attempt to create change in a relationship that feels increasingly stagnant. Grace struggles with feeling that she has compromised too much of herself for a marriage that doesn't nurture her emotional needs. She's recently reconnected with old friends from the art world, sparking jealousy in Trip and intensifying their marital tension."
